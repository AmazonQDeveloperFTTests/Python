# Wave Formula Calculations

"""
Background:
The Wave Formulas are for calculating the characteristics
of a wave. 

Used for stuff like the:- 

1. Speed of a wave in water
2. Frequency of wave a in air
3. Frequency of an electromagnetic - basically like light - wave

Note:- Above are just some of the many cases this formula can be applied to.

This calculator is not really meant for light.
It can be used for it, just know that you will need to input the speed of light
again and again because no constant has been assigned to it.

Not sure if this can work for really big numbers.

#----- Demo -----#
v = 0  # in m/s
wavelength = 25  # in meters
frequency = 5  # in Hz

v = wavelength * frequency
# To make output look like actual code
print(f"""
Demo:-
v = 0 
wavelength = 25  
frequency = 5  

Now, 
Wave Speed (v) = wavelength * frequency
or, v = {wavelength}m * {frequency}Hz
Therefore, v = {v}

# Hashes

Hashes are a way to generate a string of characters (both letters and numbers) from an input (another string or a file) and are designed in such a way that even the barest change in the input will completely change the output.

Nowadays, they are used to ensure that the file you received is indeed the one sent by the other party. It is still possible that two completely different input will produce the same output, but such cases are extremely unlikely to happen

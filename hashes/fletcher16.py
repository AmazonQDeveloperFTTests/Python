The Fletcher checksum is an algorithm for computing a position-dependent checksum devised by John G. Fletcher (1934â€“2012) at Lawrence Livermore Labs in the late 1970s.[1] The objective of the Fletcher checksum was to provide error-detection properties approaching those of a cyclic redundancy check but with the lower computational effort associated with summation techniques.

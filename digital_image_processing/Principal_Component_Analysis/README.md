# Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with Digits Dataset

This is a demonstration of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) using the Digits dataset from scikit-learn.

## About the Project

This project demonstrates how to apply Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the Digits dataset using scikit-learn. PCA is a dimensionality reduction technique that helps visualize and reduce the dimensionality of a dataset while preserving its important information. It's widely used in machine learning and data analysis.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you need the following Python libraries installed:

- scikit-learn
- numpy
- matplotlib

You can install them using pip:

```bash


pip install scikit-learn numpy matplotlib


```

#### Dataset:
[Digits Dataset](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/datasets/plot_digits_last_image.html)


### Usage
Run the provided Jupyter Notebook (digits_pca.ipynb) to see PCA applied to the Digits dataset. The code will load the Digits dataset, apply PCA, and display the reduced-dimension data as output.

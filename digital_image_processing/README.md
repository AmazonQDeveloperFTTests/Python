# Digital Image Processing

Digital Image Processing (DIP) is when you are processing and applying changes to an image with a computer.
Because an image can be considered as a signal, DIP is a subcategory of Digital Signal Processing. Similar algorithms can be applied in DSP with few tweaks to make (to match the type of the signal).

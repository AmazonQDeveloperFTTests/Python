Prerequisites:- you need to have visual studio code

Install Docker

Docker Desktop
Download and install Docker Desktop, or an alternative Docker option, like Docker on a remote host or Docker compliant CLI.

Start Docker
Run the Docker Desktop application to start Docker. You will know it's running if you look in the activity tray and see the Docker whale icon.

Docker might take a few minutes to start. If the whale icon is animated, it is probably still in the process of starting. You can click on the icon to see the status.

Check Docker
Once Docker is running, you can confirm that everything is working by opening a new terminal window and typing the command:-
docker --version


Install the extension
The Dev Containers extension lets you run Visual Studio Code inside a Docker container.

# Getting Started with DevContainer

This guide will walk you through the steps to set up and start using our DevContainer for [Your Project Name].

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

1. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
2. [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

## Step 1: Clone the Repository

If you haven't already, clone the repository for [Your Project Name] to your local machine:

shell
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-project.git
cd your-project

## Step 2: Install the Visual Studio Code Extensions
Open Visual Studio Code (VS Code), and install the following extensions:

Remote - Containers

## Step 3: Open the Project in VS Code
Launch VS Code.
Open the project folder you cloned in Step 1 by selecting File > Open Folder and navigating to the project folder.

## Step 4: Build and Start the DevContainer
In VS Code, press Ctrl + Shift + P (Windows/Linux) or Cmd + Shift + P (macOS) to open the command palette.
Type Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container and select it from the list.
VS Code will automatically detect the configuration in .devcontainer/devcontainer.json and build the DevContainer environment.
This process may take a few minutes, as it will download and set up the required Docker containers.

## Step 5: Accessing the DevContainer
Once the DevContainer is up and running, you will have a fully configured development environment. You can access it like a local development environment within VS Code.

## Step 6: Developing in the DevContainer
You can now start coding and working on your project within the DevContainer. All the tools and dependencies are pre-configured and ready to use.

## Step 7: Stopping and Restarting the DevContainer
To stop the DevContainer, simply close VS Code. To restart it, follow Step 4 again.

# How To use the DevConatiner

In this section we are going learn how to run Visual Studio Code in a Docker container using the Dev Containers extension.
Running VS Code inside a Docker container can be useful for many reasons, but in this walkthrough we'll focus on using a Docker container to set up a development environment that is separate from your local environment.

## Getting Started

1. **INSTALL VS CODE** : You need Visual Studio Code installed.
2. **INSTALL DOCKER**
   1. Docker is needed to create and manage your containers.
   2. Download and install Docker Desktop, or an alternative Docker option, like Docker on a remote host or Docker compliant        CLI
   3. Run the Docker Desktop application to start Docker. You will know it's running if you look in the activity tray and          see the Docker whale icon.

Docker might take a few minutes to start. If the whale icon is animated, it is probably still in the process of starting. You can click on the icon to see the status.

Backtracking is a general algorithmic technique used to find all (or some) solutions to a problem that incrementally builds candidates to the solutions and abandons a candidate ("backtracks") as soon as it's determined that the candidate cannot possibly be completed to a valid solution.

Here's a simple example of how backtracking can be implemented in Python:

```python
def is_valid(candidate):
    # Check if the candidate is a valid solution.
    pass

def backtrack(candidate):
    if is_valid(candidate):
        # If the candidate is a valid solution, process it.
        process_solution(candidate)
    else:
        for next_candidate in generate_candidates(candidate):
            # Generate the next candidates and recursively call the backtrack function.
            backtrack(next_candidate)

def generate_candidates(candidate):
    # Generate the next candidates based on the current candidate.
    pass

def process_solution(candidate):
    # Process and display the valid solution.
    print(candidate)

# Example usage:
initial_candidate = initialize_candidate()
backtrack(initial_candidate)
```

In this pseudocode:

- `is_valid(candidate)` checks if the current candidate is a valid solution.
- `generate_candidates(candidate)` generates the next candidates based on the current candidate.
- `process_solution(candidate)` processes and displays valid solutions.

You'll need to adapt this structure to your specific problem. Backtracking is often used for combinatorial problems like the N-Queens puzzle, Sudoku, or the traveling salesman problem, where you systematically explore possible solutions while avoiding invalid paths.

Make sure to implement the `is_valid`, `generate_candidates`, and `process_solution` functions to fit your particular problem.

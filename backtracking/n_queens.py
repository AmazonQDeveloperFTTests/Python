"""

 The nqueens problem is of placing N queens on a N * N
 chess board such that no queen can attack any other queens placed
 on that chess board.
 This means that one queen cannot have any other queen on its horizontal, vertical and
 diagonal lines.

"""
"""

The N Queens puzzle is a classic problem in computer science and mathematics.
It involves placing N chess queens on an NÃ—N chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other.
The challenge comes from the way queens move in chess: they can move any number of squares vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.
Therefore, the solution to the puzzle requires that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal.

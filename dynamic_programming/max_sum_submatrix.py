"""
The maximum submatrix sum problem is the task of finding the maximum sum that can be
obtained from a contiguous submatrix within a given 3D matrix of numbers. For example, given
the matrix 
[[-2, 1, -3], 
 [4, -1, 2], 
 [1, -5, 4]], the contiguous submatrix with the maximum sum
is [[4, -1, 2], 
    [1, -5, 4]], so the maximum submatrix sum is 6.

Kadane's algorithm is a simple dynamic programming algorithm that solves the maximum
subarray sum problem in O(n) time and O(1) space. We modify this algorithm to solve the maximum
submatrix sum problem in O(nm^2) time and O(n) space.

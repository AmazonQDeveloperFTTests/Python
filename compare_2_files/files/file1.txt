Light pollution occurs because of the prominent excess illumination in some areas. Artificial lights disrupt the world`s ecosystems. They have deadly effects on many creatures including mammals, plants, amphibians, insects, and birds. Every year many bird species die colliding with needlessly illuminated buildings. Moreover, artificial lights can lead baby sea turtles to their demise.

Noise pollution takes place when noise and unpleasant sounds cause temporary disruption in the natural balance. It is usually caused by industrialization, social events, poor urban planning, household chores, transportation, and construction activities. Noise pollution leads to hearing problems, health issues, cardiovascular issues, sleeping disorders, and trouble communicating. Moreover, it affects wildlife a lot. Some animals may suffer from hearing loss while others become inefficient at hunting. It is very important to understand noise pollution in order to lower its impact on the environment.

Radioactive pollution is the presence of radioactive substances in the environment. It is highly dangerous when it occurs. Radioactive contamination can be caused by breaches at nuclear power plants or improper transport of radioactive chemicals. Radioactive material should be handled with great care as radiation destroys cells in living organisms that can result in illness or even death.

# Data Structures

There exist [many](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_data_structures) types of data structures, but some structures are more prone to keep some type of data over another type.
The types used everywhere when programming is the boolean, the integer, the character and the floating point number. Those can lead to more advanced type, such as list, array, set, tuple, stack etc.

(If this subject has your interest, you should do your own research because it's a vast subject. As often, the starting point should Wikipedia page.)

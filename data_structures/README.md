There exist [many](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_data_structures) type of data structures, but some structures are more prone to keep some type of data over another type.
The one used everywhere when programming are the boolean, integer, character, floating point number. Those can lead to more advanced type, such as list, array, set, tuple, stack etc.

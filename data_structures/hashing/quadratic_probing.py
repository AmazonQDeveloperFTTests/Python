"""
Hashing is a technique that  uses a hash function that converts a given  number 
or any other key to a smaller number and uses the small number as the index in a table called a hash table. 

Hash Function: 
A function that converts a given big number to a small practical integer value. 
The mapped integer value is used as an index in the hash table. 

Quadratic Probing: 
Quadratic probing is an open-addressing scheme where we look for the i^2th slot in the iâ€™th iteration 
if the given hash value x collides in the hash table. 

The logic is

For the loop of the array, running from 0 to array length, given x is an element of the array
1 - Check if the slot hash(x) % SizeofHashtable is full, then we try (hash(x) + 1*1) % SizeofHashtable.
2 - then check if (hash(x) + 1*1) % SizeofHashtable is also full, then we try (hash(x) + 2*2) % SizeofHashtable.
3 - then check If (hash(x) + 2*2) % SizeofHashtable is also full, then we try (hash(x) + 3*3) % SizeofHashtable.
...
This process is repeated for all the values of i until an empty slot is found.

"""

Let G be a tree.

For every query of the form (u, v)
we want to find the LCA of the nodes
u and v, i.e. we want to find a node w that lies
on the path from u to the root node, that
lies on the path from v to the root node,
and if there are multiple nodes we pick the
one that is farthest away from the root node.
 
In other words the desired node w is the
lowest ancestor of u and v.
In particular if u is an ancestor of v,
then u is their lowest common ancestor.

This algorithm will need O(Nlog N) for 
preprocessing the tree,
and then O(log N) for each LCA query.

PROBLEM : Find majority element in the given array.

PROBLEM DESCRIPTION : 
Given a array of elements of size n.
The majority element is the element that appears more than [n/2] times.
We assume that the majority element is always exists in the array.

EXAMPLE : 
    input : array = [1,3,5,1,1]
    output : 1
    explanation : 1 appears three times in array which is greater than [n/2] i.e [5/2] = 2.

APPROACH:
- In an array of elements of size n there exists only one element that appears greater than [n/2] times.

- If we sort the given elements in the array the [n/2] element in the array must be the majority element.
    if we sort [1,3,5,1,1] it will be [1,1,1,3,5] 
    element present in the [n/2] index of the sorted array is majority element i.e 1 where n is size of array.

"""
In this problem, we find all subsequences of a given list using backtracking.
Time Complexity: O(2^n), where n is the list's length.

Functions:
- generate_all_subsequences: Initiates backtracking and prints subsequences.
- create_state_space_tree: Recursively builds a state-space tree for subsequences.

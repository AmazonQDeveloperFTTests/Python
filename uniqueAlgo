Creating a unique algorithm in Python depends on the specific problem or task you want to solve. However, 
I can provide an example of a simple unique algorithm, such as generating a list of unique elements from a given list. 
Here's a Python function that accomplishes this task:

def unique_elements(input_list):
    unique_list = []
    for item in input_list:
        if item not in unique_list:
            unique_list.append(item)
    return unique_list

# Example usage:
my_list = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 6]
result = unique_elements(my_list)
print(result)  # Output will be [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

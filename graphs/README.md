#Graphs
A graph is a visual representation of a collection of objects where some object pairs are linked together. 
Vertices are the points used to represent the interconnected objects, and edges are the connections between 
them. This directory includes some of the most important graph algorithms used in Python to illustrate how various algorithms work visually.
They help and support us in comprehending the operation of a specific algorithm as well as the functionality as a whole.

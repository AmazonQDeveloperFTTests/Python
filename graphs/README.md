# Graphs

A graph is a visual representation of a collection of objects where some object pairs are linked together. 
Vertices are the points used to represent the interconnected objects, and edges are the connections between them. 
This directory includes some of the most important graph algorithms used in Python to illustrate how various algorithms 
work visually. They help and support us in comprehending the operation of a specific algorithm as well as the functionality as a whole.
This section has graphs  which can be sorting algorithms, ways to find the shortest path, and even problems from topics like spanning trees.
This section contains graph programs written in python that can be sorting algorithms, shortest-path computations, or even issues related to 
spanning trees and greedy based algorithms.

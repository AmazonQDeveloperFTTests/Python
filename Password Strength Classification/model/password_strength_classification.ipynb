        "##Password Strength Classification.\n",
        "Password strength is a measure of the effectiveness of a password against guessing or brute-force attacks.\n",
        "\n",
        "In its usual form, it estimates how many trials an attacker who does not have direct access to the password would need, on average, to guess it correctly.\n",
        "The strength of a password is a function of length, complexity, and unpredictability.\n",
        "\n",
        "Using strong passwords lowers overall risk of a security breach, but strong passwords do not replace the need for other effective security controls.\n",
        "\n",
        "The effectiveness of a password of a given strength is strongly determined by the design and implementation of the factors (knowledge, ownership, inherence).\n",
        "In this project we will classify strength of password as three values(0 , 1 , 2) i.e. 0 for weak, 1 for medium, 2 for strong using machine learning algorithm.\n",
        "\n",
        "Steps followed in this project are:\n",

        "Step 1 Data preprocessing & exploration.\n",

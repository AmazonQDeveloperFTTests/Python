# Compression

Data compression is everywhere, you need it to store data without taking too much space.
Either the compression lose some data (then we talk about lossy compression, such as .jpg) or it does not (and then it is lossless compression, such as .png)

Lossless compression is mainly used for archive purpose as it allow storing data without losing information about the file archived. On the other hand, lossy compression is used for transfer of file where quality isn't necessarily what is required (i.e: images on Twitter).

## Data Compression algorithms using Python

Python can be used with many different techniques and algorithms for data compression. We can use InterCoding methodologies, for instance, to test the syntax of Python code using Huffman coding, position codes, and Lempel-ziv compression. We can also attempt to perform lossless data compressions using the arithmetic encoding method, which can be crucial when used with image compression. In some ways, data science and ultimately the fields of machine learning and artificial intelligence can benefit from these compression techniques.

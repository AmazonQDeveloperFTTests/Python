# Compression

Data compression is everywhere, you need it to store data without taking too much space.
Either the compression lose some data (such as images in .jpg) or it can be lossless (.png).

Lossless compression is mainly used for archive purpose as it allow storing more data without losing information about the file archived. On the other hand, lossy compression is used for transfer of file where quality isn't necessarily what is required (i.e: images on Twitter).

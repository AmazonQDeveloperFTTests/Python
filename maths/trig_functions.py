"""
The 6 normal trig functions and their inverses. In theory, I could 
have used a CORDIC algorithm https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CORDIC
but this requires a load of pre-calculated values stored in some
list. In keeping with the spirit of what this repository aims to
achieve, I decided to use a taylor series expansion so that everything
is clear

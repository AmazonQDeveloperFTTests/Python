* Wondering how this method works !
* It's pretty simple.
* Let's say you need to calculate a ^ b
* RULE 1 : a * b = (a+a) * (b/2) ---- example : 4 * 4 = (4+4) * (4/2) = 8 * 2
* RULE 2 : IF b is ODD, then ---- a * b = a + (a * (b - 1)) :: where (b - 1) is even.
* Once b is even, repeat the process to get a * b
* Repeat the process till b = 1 OR b = 0, because a*1 = a AND a*0 = 0
*
* As far as the modulo is concerned,
* the fact : (a+b) % c = ((a%c) + (b%c)) % c
* Now apply RULE 1 OR 2, whichever is required.

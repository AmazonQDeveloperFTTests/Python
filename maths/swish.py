"""
This script demonstrates the implementation of the Swish function.

The function takes a vector x of K real numbers as input and then
returns x * sigmoid(x).
Swish is a smooth, non-monotonic function defined as
f(x) = x Â·sigmoid(x).
Extensive experiments shows that Swish consistently
matches or outperforms ReLU on deep networks applied to a variety
of challenging domains such as image classification and
machine translation.

Given a n by n board where n is of form 2k where k >= 1 (Basically n is a power of 2 with minimum value as 2).
The board has one missing cell (of size 1 x 1). Fill the board using L shaped tiles.
A L shaped tile is a 2 x 2 square with one cell of size 1Ã—1 missing.

This problem can be solved using Divide and Conquer. Below is the recursive algorithm.

// n is size of given square, p is location of missing cell
Tile(int n, Point p)

1) Base case: n = 2, A 2 x 2 square with one cell missing is nothing
   but a tile and can be filled with a single tile.

2) Place a L shaped tile at the center such that it does not cover
   the n/2 * n/2 subsquare that has a missing square. Now all four
   subsquares of size n/2 x n/2 have a missing cell (a cell that doesn't
   need to be filled).  See figure 2 below.

3) Solve the problem recursively for following four. Let p1, p2, p3 and
   p4 be positions of the 4 missing cells in 4 squares.
   a) Tile(n/2, p1)
   b) Tile(n/2, p2)
   c) Tile(n/2, p3)
   d) Tile(n/2, p3)

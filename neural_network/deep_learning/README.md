# Deep Learning

Deep learning is a class of machine learning algorithms thatâ€Šuses multiple layers to progressively extract higher-level features from the raw input. For example, in image processing, lower layers may identify edges, while higher layers may identify the concepts relevant to a human such as digits or letters or faces.

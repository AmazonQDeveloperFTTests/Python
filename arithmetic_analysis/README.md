## Vectors
In Linear Algebra, a vector represents a quantity with both magnitude and direction. Vectors can be in two or three dimensions but are often extended to higher dimensions in advanced applications. Key vector operations include addition, subtraction, scalar multiplication, and the dot product.

## Matrices
Matrices are rectangular arrays of numbers, often used to represent linear transformations or systems of linear equations. They have rows and columns and can be added, multiplied, and transposed.

## Vector Operations
Addition and Subtraction
Vector addition combines two vectors of the same dimension by adding their corresponding components. Subtraction works similarly.

Scalar Multiplication
Scalar multiplication multiplies a vector by a scalar (a single number), resulting in a new vector where each component is multiplied by the scalar.

Dot Product
The dot product (also known as the inner product) of two vectors returns a scalar. It's the sum of the products of their corresponding components and is useful for finding angles and projections.

## Matrix Operations
Matrix Addition and Subtraction
Matrix addition and subtraction are performed element-wise on matrices of the same size.

Matrix Multiplication
Matrix multiplication combines two matrices to produce a new one. The product's dimensions depend on the original matrices' sizes.

Transposition
The transpose of a matrix switches its rows and columns. It's denoted as A^T, and its main use is in solving linear systems.

## Linear Transformations
Linear transformations are functions that map vectors from one space to another while preserving addition and scalar multiplication properties. They can be represented by matrices and include rotations, scalings, and shears.

## Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
Eigenvalues and eigenvectors are essential in linear algebra. They help describe how matrices affect vectors during linear transformations. Eigenvalues represent scaling factors, while eigenvectors represent directions unaffected by the transformation.

## Applications
Linear Algebra has a broad range of applications:

Computer Graphics: Used for 3D rendering, animation, and image processing.
Machine Learning: Essential in algorithms like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and solving linear regression problems.
Engineering: Used in solving systems of linear equations in structural analysis and electrical circuits.
Physics: Describes physical phenomena using matrices and vectors.
Data Science: Important in data analysis and feature engineering.

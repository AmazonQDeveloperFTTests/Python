"""
Each of the six faces on a cube has a different digit (0 to 9) written on it; the same
is done to a second cube. By placing the two cubes side-by-side in different positions
we can form a variety of 2-digit numbers.

For example, the square number 64 could be formed:
ï¿¼
In fact, by carefully choosing the digits on both cubes it is possible to display all
of the square numbers below one-hundred: 01, 04, 09, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, and 81.

For example, one way this can be achieved is by placing {0, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9} on one cube
and {1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9} on the other cube.

However, for this problem we shall allow the 6 or 9 to be turned upside-down so that an
arrangement like {0, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9} and {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7} allows for all nine square
numbers to be displayed; otherwise it would be impossible to obtain 09.

In determining a distinct arrangement we are interested in the digits on each cube, not
the order.

{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} is equivalent to {3, 6, 4, 1, 2, 5}
{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} is distinct from {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9}

But because we are allowing 6 and 9 to be reversed, the two distinct sets in the last
example both represent the extended set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9} for the purpose of
forming 2-digit numbers.

How many distinct arrangements of the two cubes allow for all of the square numbers to
be displayed?

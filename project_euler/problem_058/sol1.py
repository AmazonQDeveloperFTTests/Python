    Starting with 1 and spiralling anticlockwise in the following way, 
    a square spiral with side length 7 is formed.

    37 36 35 34 33 32 31
    38 17 16 15 14 13 30
    39 18  5  4  3 12 29
    40 19  6  1  2 11 28
    41 20  7  8  9 10 27
    42 21 22 23 24 25 26
    43 44 45 46 47 48 49

    It is interesting to note that the odd squares lie along 
    the bottom right diagonal, but what is more interesting is 
    that 8 out of the 13 numbers lying along both 
    diagonals are prime; that is, a ratio of 8/13 â‰ˆ 62%.

    If one complete new layer is wrapped around the spiral 
    above, a square spiral with side length 9 will be formed. 
    If this process is continued, what is the side length of the square spiral for 
    which the ratio of primes along both diagonals first falls below 10%?

    Instead of calculation all numbers we are only calculating the sides of the square. 
    we find these numbers by adding to the last digit we had, 
    for example 9 the current side length
    minus 1. For example:

    Side length = 5, Last digit = 9
    9 + 4 = 13, 13 + 4 = 17, 17 + 4 = 21, 21 + 4 = 25.

    So the digits on the diagonal axis are (13,17,21,25)
    and we check those to see if they are prime numbers

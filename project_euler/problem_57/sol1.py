""" projectEuler problem 57: Square root convergents
    The square root of two can be expressed as an infinite continued fraction.

    In the first one-thousand expansions,
    how many fractions contain a numerator with more digits than the denominator?
    Reference page: https://projecteuler.net/problem=57

    Working principle:
    The first expansion is (1 + 1/2)
    The successive is 1 + 1/(2 + 1/2)

    Expansion 1 has numerator = 1, denominator = 2
    1 + numerator/denominator = (numerator + denominator)/(denominator)
    Once the new numerator and denominator are computed,
    a counter is increased if the numerator has more digits than the denominator

    Note that the denominator of the fractional part
    can be attained as the previous expansion + 1
    => 1/(last_expansion + 1)
    The numerator and denominator of the fractional part of the expansion are computed
    and the process is repeated up to the 1000-th expansion

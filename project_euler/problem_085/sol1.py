By counting carefully it can be seen that a rectangular grid
measuring 3 by 2 contains eighteen rectangles

Although there exists no rectangular grid that contains 
exactly two million rectangles,
find the area of the grid with the nearest solution.
"""

def solution():

    """

    i want to take the error in finding a rectangle 
    with 2Million possible rectangle as minimum
    as possible so i have took min_diff 9000

    no of possible rectangle is n(n+1)/2 in each side
    so total possible triangle is n1(n1+1) * n2(n2+1) /4

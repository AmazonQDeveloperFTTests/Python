Consecutive prime sum
Problem 50: https://projecteuler.net/problem=50

The prime 41, can be written as the sum of six consecutive primes:

41 = 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 11 + 13
This is the longest sum of consecutive primes that adds to a prime below one-hundred.

The longest sum of consecutive primes below one-thousand that adds to a prime,
contains 21 terms, and is equal to 953.

Which prime, below 1 million, can be written as the sum of the most consecutive primes?

    Returns solution to problem.

    Algorithm:
    1. Construct a "Sieve of Eratosthenes" to get all primes till n
    (This will also serve as O(1) primality check later)
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes#Pseudocode

    2. Now make the largest size window and slide over primes,
    until we encounter the sum of slide being a prime.

    >>> solution(100)
    41

    >>> solution(1000)
    953

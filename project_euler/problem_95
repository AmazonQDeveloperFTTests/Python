Problem 95
Url: https://projecteuler.net/problem=95
Statement:
The proper divisors of a number are all the divisors excluding the number itself. For example, the proper divisors of  28 is 1,2,4,7 and 14 and . As the sum of these divisors is equal to 28, we call it a perfect number.

Interestingly the sum of the proper divisors of 220 is 284 and the sum of the proper divisors of 284 is 220 forming a chain of two numbers. For this reason, 220 and 284 are called an amicable pair.

Perhaps less well known are longer chains. For example, starting with 12496, we form a chain of five numbers:
12496 -> 14288 -> 15472 -> 14536 -> 14264(->12496 -> ....)
Since this chain returns to its starting point, it is called an amicable chain.

Find the smallest member of the longest amicable chain with no element exceeding one million.

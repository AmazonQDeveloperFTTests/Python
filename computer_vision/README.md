# Computer Vision

Computer vision is a fascinating field of computer science dedicated to enabling computers to mimic human vision processes, including image recognition, interpretation, and the extraction of meaningful information from visual data. This technology has applications in a wide range of domains, from self-driving cars to medical image analysis.

## What is Computer Vision?

At its core, computer vision strives to replicate the remarkable abilities of human vision, allowing computers to:

- **See**: Capture and acquire images or video streams from various sources, such as cameras or sensors.
- **Identify**: Recognize objects, people, text, and other visual elements within these images.
- **Process**: Analyze and manipulate images to extract relevant information.
- **Interpret**: Make decisions and take actions based on the visual data, similar to how humans perceive their surroundings.

## Image Processing vs. Computer Vision

While closely related, image processing and computer vision are distinct concepts:

- **Image Processing**: Image processing involves applying a set of algorithms to manipulate images, enhancing their quality or extracting specific features. Operations may include smoothing, contrast adjustment, and edge detection.

- **Computer Vision**: Computer vision goes beyond image processing by incorporating machine learning techniques to enable computers to understand and interpret visual data. It focuses on recognizing patterns, objects, and structures within images and videos.

### Computer Vision

Computer vision is a field of computer science that works on enabling computers to see,
identify and process images in the same way that human vision does, and then provide appropriate output.
It is like imparting human intelligence and instincts to a computer.
Image processing and computer vision are a little different from each other. Image processing means applying some algorithms for transforming image from one form to the other like smoothing, contrasting, stretching, etc.
While computer vision comes from modelling image processing using the techniques of machine learning, computer vision applies machine learning to recognize patterns for interpretation of images (much like the process of visual reasoning of human vision).

But we can say Image Processing is a part of Computer Vision for some reasons.

Image processing is like applying algorithms to images for Tranforming it to another like Smoothing , Resize etc. Suppose we have an image of 8k resolution but our computer vision classifier needs some small than 8k so first we have to do some image processing algorithm on it then it will parse into classifier.
So conclusion is that Image Processing is necessary for Computer Vision. Yeah, these have some little differneces in implementations but all are do for good response.

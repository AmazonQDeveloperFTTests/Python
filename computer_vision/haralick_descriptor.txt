The code 'computer_vision\haralick_descriptors.py' provided is already quite comprehensive, and it deals with image processing, particularly in the context of texture analysis using Haralick descriptors. However, I can suggest some general enhancements and additional features:

Modularization and Functionality Expansion:

You could further modularize the code by breaking down functionalities into separate functions, which can make it more readable and easier to maintain.
Comments and Documentation:

Adding detailed comments and function docstrings helps in understanding the code. It also makes it easier for others (and yourself in the future) to work with the code.
Error Handling:

Consider adding error handling to handle potential exceptions. For example, when opening an image file, you should check if the file exists.
Performance Optimization:

If performance is a concern, you might consider using optimized libraries or algorithms for specific tasks. For example, for some operations, OpenCV might be more efficient than manual numpy operations.
Input Validation:

Make sure to validate input data, especially when reading user input. This helps prevent errors or unexpected behavior.
Testing:

Consider writing unit tests to verify the correctness of your functions. This can be especially important if the code is part of a larger project.
File Handling:

Add checks to ensure that the files exist before trying to open or process them.
Logging:

Implement a logging system to record important events or debug information. This can be invaluable for diagnosing issues.
Configurability:

You could add options to configure parameters like kernel sizes, thresholds, etc., so that users can experiment with different settings.
Parallelization:

Depending on the size of the images and the number of images to process, you might benefit from parallelizing some operations to speed up processing.

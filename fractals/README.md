# Fractals

Fractals are self-similar objects and appear the same at different levels of 'zoom'.

As fractalfoundation.org say:
> "A fractal is a never-ending pattern. [...] They are created by repeating a simple process over and over in an ongoing feedback loop. Driven by recursion, fractals are images of dynamic systems â€“ the pictures of Chaos."

# What is Machine Learning ?

- Arthur Samuel, a pioneer in the field of artificial intelligence and computer gaming, coined the term “Machine Learning”.
- He defined machine learning as – “Field of study that gives computers the capability to learn without being explicitly programmed”. 
- The process starts with feeding good quality data and then training our machines(computers) by building machine learning models using the data and different algorithms. 
- The choice of algorithms depends on what type of data do we have and what kind of task we are trying to automate.
- Machine learning algorithms use historical data as input to predict new output values.
- Machine learning (ML) is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that allows software applications to become more accurate at predicting outcomes without being explicitly programmed to do so.

# Best Python Libraries for Machine Learning :

In the older days, people used to perform Machine Learning tasks by manually coding all the algorithms and mathematical and statistical formula. 
This made the process time consuming, tedious and inefficient. But in the modern days, it is become very much easy and efficient compared to the olden days by various python libraries, frameworks, and modules.
Today, Python is one of the most popular programming languages for this task and it has replaced many languages in the industry, one of the reason is its vast collection of libraries. Python libraries that used in Machine Learning are:

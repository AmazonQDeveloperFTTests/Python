"""
This will show how to handle imbalanced dataset.
Imbalanced datasets are those which contain more no. of records for one class 
as compared to other class (say 80-20)

Two main ways of handling imbalanced datasets :
1. Undersampling which consists in down-sizing the majority class by removing 
   observations until the dataset is balanced.
2. Oversampling which consists in over-sizing the minority class by adding 
   observations.

It is clear from the data that it contains more datapoints class 1

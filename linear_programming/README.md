# Linear Programming
Sub-field of mathematical optimisation, where the best solution is found while satisfying linear functions.

Taking this linear program as an example
```
    Maximise P = 8x1 + 6x2
    subject to:   x1 +  x2 <= 20
                  x1       >= 5
                        x2  = 6
    with:
               x1 >= 0, x2 >= 0
```
x1 could be the number of blue cars and x2 the number of red cars produced. The company would be trying to maximise profit P.

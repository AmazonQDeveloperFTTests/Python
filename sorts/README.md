# Sorting Algorithms
Sorting is the process of putting data in a specific order. The way to arrange data in a specific order
is specified by the sorting algorithm. The most typical orders are lexical or numerical. The significance
of sorting lies in the fact that, if data is stored in a sorted manner, data searching can be highly optimised.
Data representation in more readable formats is another use for sorting.

This section contains alot of important algorithms that helps us to use sorting algorithms in various scenarios.
